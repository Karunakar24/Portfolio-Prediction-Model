# 📈 Portfolio Prediction Model
### Leveraging Machine Learning for Financial Forecasting

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a machine learning–based portfolio prediction system designed to forecast stock prices and evaluate portfolio performance using historical financial data. The system applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series forecasting and compares results with a Random Forest Regressor to identify the most effective predictive approach.

The model focuses on a sample portfolio consisting of Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Google (GOOGL), and provides actionable insights through profit and loss analysis to support data-driven investment decisions.
